Course: NLP (Semester 6) - Pillai College of Engineering
ðŸ“– Project Overview
This project is part of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) course for Semester 6 students at Pillai College of Engineering. The project, "Content Plagiarism Detection,"is the process of identifying instances where content has been copied or paraphrased without proper attribution. In this project, we develop a system that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically detect and classify plagiarized content in text documents.

The goal is to build a robust solution that goes beyond simple string matching and is capable of identifying semantic similarity, paraphrasing, and near-duplicate content across a corpus of documents. This system is particularly useful in academic, content creation, and publishing domains where originality is crucial.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Abstract
The aim of this project is to develop an intelligent plagiarism detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and compare textual content for similarity. The system will identify and highlight plagiarized text by leveraging methods such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and deep learning-based models like BERT. By detecting both direct copy-paste plagiarism and paraphrased content, the project seeks to enhance content originality verification and provide an effective solution for academic institutions, content creators, and organizations.

 Comparative Analysis:
The comparative analysis of different models highlights their effectiveness in classifying financial texts into the correct sentiment category (positive, negative, neutral). The following table summarizes the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the models tested:

Conclusion
Plagiarism detection through Natural Language Processing offers a powerful and intelligent approach to maintaining content originality. By leveraging both traditional techniques like TF-IDF and cosine similarity, along with modern deep learning models such as BERT, the system can effectively identify not only exact matches but also semantic similarities and paraphrased content.
